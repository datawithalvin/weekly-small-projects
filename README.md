# Weekly Small Projects

Yo, welcome to my Weekly Small Projects Repo! This space is dedicated to showcasing my journey in data science, analytics, and engineering through a series of small.

While this repository primarily documents my personal projects, I am open to suggestions, feedback, and collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you have ideas or insights to share.
